- 👋 Hi, I’m @carlos-lima
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Digital Twins and Knowledge Represenation). Also I have been learning and interested in Microservices and Cloud Computing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Microservices, Cloud Computing, and giving my first steps in Machine Learning. Besides all that, sometimes I spend some time learning about Web Development Technoligies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can learn new tools and techniques related to AI powered by Cloud. I have some years of experience in Project Management, but I'm looking forward to develop new skills and if I would be able to give one contribution to help you I will be more than happy.
